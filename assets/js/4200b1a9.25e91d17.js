The age-old EHR systems, teeming with irrelevant\\nfields and buttons, can bring back painful memories. What exacerbates this is\\nthat these traditional EHRs are focused on appointments and billing\\ninstead of being focused on providing care.\\n\\nSummer Health focuses on direct-to-consumer care that\'s available around the\\nclock. We\'re not just streamlining healthcare for parents; we\'re tailoring it\\nfor the pediatricians so they can provide the highest quality care without\\nbeing burdened by outdated tech.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWe envision a healthcare experience that enables quality care without\\nsacrificing simplicity and security. From this vision, CareOS was born. However,\\ncreating a new healthcare experience from the ground up takes a lot of work,\\nand we\'re not interested in reinventing the wheel. This post covers some core\\nconcepts that were and continue to be important to us as we build a world-class\\nhealthcare experience.\\n\\n## The Right Foundation\\n\\nThe fastest way to a skeptical look is by telling someone you\'re going\\nto build an EHR from scratch. It\'s a daunting task, and skepticism is warranted.\\nThat\'s why while we knew we needed a better experience for our pediatricians,\\nbuilding everything from scratch wasn\'t the right approach. We explored different\\nheadless and headed options, weighing the limitations and expenses. We needed the\\nflexibility to build a custom experience without committing to a future operational\\nnightmare.\\n\\nThat\'s where Medplum came into play. Developer-friendly and forward-thinking,\\nMedplum\'s healthcare platform resonated with our vision and allowed us\\nto build a high quality experience without starting from 0.\\n\\n## Identity Management\\n\\nBeing a seed-stage company, Summer Health must keep the identities involved in\\nhealthcare flexible. As we evolve and uncover new product dimensions, there\'s a\\npressing need for adaptability. Yet, security remains paramount and clinical\\ndata access needs to be restricted only to pertinent entities.\\n\\nRecognizing this, we aimed for a healthcare platform that offers flexible\\n[identity management](https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth). So\\nwhether it\u2019s a Summer Health employee, a partnering practitioner or a parent,\\nwe can operate in one environment under one auth umbrella.\\n\\n## Access Control\\n\\nFiguring out identity management was just the tip of the iceberg. Pediatrics has\\na unique challenge in terms of data access. Unlike other specialties, a\\npediatric patient\'s clinical data must be accessible by different identities,\\nlike parents or guardians. So, how do we ensure that the right individuals have\\nthe correct access while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data?\\nThis complexity needs a\\n[nuanced approach to access control](https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth/access-control),\\nand we needed a platform with an answer.\\n\\n## Everything is on FHIR \ud83d\udd25\\n\\nOur vision was broader than the present. We knew our data storage methods\\ntoday would impact future interoperability with partners and other healthcare\\nsystems. This led us to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), a\\nstandard framework for clinical data storage. Adopting FHIR meant ensuring our\\ndata remains legible outside the confines of Summer Health, promising a brighter\\nfuture for our patients and their relationships with other clinical entities.\\n\\n## Mobile First\\n\\nOur pediatricians, much like our parents, rely on mobile devices. The availability\\nof Summer Health across the US, every single day of the week, 24 hours a day, is\\nrooted in mobile accessibility. It\'s pivotal for our pediatricians to\\nprovide uninterrupted, high-quality care, irrespective of their location.\\nWe wanted to craft a user-friendly, mobile-first experience for them, ensuring\\nthey have all the necessary information at their fingertips to provide\\nthe highest quality care.\\n\\n![CareOS screenshots](./care-os-screenshots.png)\\n\\n## More to Come\\n\\nSummer Health\u2019s path to revolutionize pediatric care starts with ensuring our\\npediatricians have the best tools to provide the best care. We\u2019ll continue to\\nshare more about how we\u2019re building CareOS as we continue this journey.

When we first started building our applications\\nlast summer our main focus was to move quickly while building a base for the future.\\nAt first, tailwind seemed like the right choice. If offered us a simple CSS utility\\ninterface to build out pages quickly and easily. In addition, there are several\\nsites with well-documented tailwind recipes we were able to lean on. However, as\\ntime passed, we started to encounter issues with relying upon tailwind alone.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why we re-evaluated\\n\\nAs we continued to build, we began to notice a few issues. First, the pages of our\\nsite began to drift in design. On some pages, we began to notice small inconsistencies\\nin spacing and layout between sections of content. We began building components\\nto manage page sections but we wondered if there was a better way. The second, and\\nmore compelling reason we decided to re-evaluate, although there are component libraries\\nthat are built on tailwind (and we tried a few), we realized to move more quickly\\nand consistently we need an extensive component library we can easily theme. After\\nevaluating several options, MUI was the standout winner.\\n\\n## Choosing MUI\\n\\nIf you haven\'t heard of [MUI](https://mui.com/). MUI is a comprehensive and free\\nreact component library system that is built on the philosophy of Google Material\\nDesign. Their documentation is extensive and they offer demos with code examples\\nin their documentation to help you learn how to customize. Speaking of customization,\\ntheir theming system allows you to build your variants into the main theme system\\nso that we can build consistency across the application; while also offering a simple\\nway of doing overrides. One of the big plusses of going with MUI was its usage of\\nGoogle Material Design; although MUI does deviate from Material Design they are\\nworking towards consistency in the future. It allowed us to build a common language\\nbetween our engineering team and the design team. Which we\'ve used to create our\\napplications MUI theme.\\n\\n### Setting up our theme system\\n\\nAt Summer Health we use [nx](https://nx.dev/) to manage our applications codebase.\\nTo help make our design and component system accessible to various applications we\\ncreated a `ui` library to house our theme and components. Below I\'ll lay out how\\nwe intergraded our color system into our MUI theme.\\n\\nOur designers take advantage of Figma for building our designs. Material design,\\nlike many popular design systems, offers a [figma design kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460/Material-3-Design-Kit)\\nwe were able to take advantage of color and theme our components.\\n\\n![Figma color scheme](./colors-figma.png)\\n\\nWith it, we created a trimmed-down version based on our application needs with an\\neasy ability to expand.\\n\\nFrom here we were able to translate those colors into our MUI theme. Below is a\\nsnippet of our color theme.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport { experimental_extendTheme as extendTheme } from \'@mui/material/styles\';\\n\\nexport const theme = extendTheme({\\n  // other customizations...\\n  sunrise: {\\n    light: {\\n      primary: {\\n        main: \'#FFC220\',\\n        onMain: \'#171515\',\\n        active: \'#F2A612\',\\n        onActive: \'#171515\',\\n        focus: \'#FFC220\',\\n        onFocus: \'#171515\',\\n        focusBorder: \'#F2A612\',\\n        disabled: \'#F2E2C4\',\\n        onDisabled: \'#171515\',\\n      },\\n      secondary: {\\n        main: \'#F2E2C4\',\\n        onMain: \'#171515\',\\n        active: \'#F5DAA7\',\\n        onActive: \'#171515\',\\n        focus: \'#F5DAA7\',\\n        onFocus: \'#171515\',\\n        focusBorder: \'#F2E2C4\',\\n        disabled: \'#F2E2C4\',\\n        onDisabled: \'#171515\',\\n      },\\n      // other color palette options...\\n    },\\n  },\\n});\\n```\\n\\nNow that our color system has been set up we can then translate that into our components.\\n\\n![Figma buttons](./buttons-figma.png)\\n\\nBelow is an example of how we translated our color scheme into our button components.\\n\\n```javascript\\nexport const theme = extendTheme({\\n  // other customizations...\\n  components: {\\n    MuiButton: {\\n      defaultProps: {\\n        disableElevation: true,\\n      },\\n      styleOverrides: {\\n        root: ({ theme, ownerState }) => ({\\n          ...TypographySunrise[\'label.medium\'],\\n          backgroundColor: `var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-main)`,\\n          color: `var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-onMain)`,\\n          border: `2px solid var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-main)`,\\n          \':hover\': {\\n            backgroundColor: `var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-active)`,\\n            color: `var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-onActive)`,\\n            border: `2px solid var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-active)`,\\n          },\\n          \':focus\': {\\n            backgroundColor: `var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-focus)`,\\n            color: `var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-onFocus)`,\\n            border: `2px solid var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-focusBorder)`,\\n          },\\n          \':disabled\': {\\n            backgroundColor: `var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-disabled)`,\\n            color: alpha(\\n              theme.sunrise[theme.palette.mode][ownerState.color].onFocus,\\n              0.38,\\n            ),\\n            border: `2px solid var(--mui-sunrise-${theme.palette.mode}-${ownerState.color}-disabled)`,\\n          },\\n        }),\\n      },\\n    },\\n    // other customizations...\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nWith our themes and components configured, we needed a way to share that with our\\nengineers and our designers. In comes Storybook for the assist! [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)\\nAs their website states; Storybook offers developers a way of building UI components\\nin isolation and while doing so provides a way to build documentation. We\'ll be\\ntalking more about how we build components, and take advantage of Storybook, in a\\nfuture blog post.\\n\\nThanks to Storybook we have been able to provide a story sharing our color styles\\nand their definition with our cross-functional team.\\n\\n![Colors](./colors.png)\\n\\nWe are also able to showcase our various button variants.\\n\\n![Buttons](./buttons.png)\\n\\n## Wrapping up\\n\\nTailwind has been growing in popularity and can offer engineering teams a way of\\nquickly building out scalable efficient pages. However, MUI offers a highly customizable\\ntheming system to build consistent layouts with an extensive library of prebuilt\\ncomponents that have allowed us to build our latest features quickly and consistently.\\n\\n## Additional reading material\\n\\n- [Material Design Styles](https://m3.material.io/styles)\\n- [Why Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/why-storybook)\\n- [Material UI - Overview](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)\\n- [A guide to material design with react](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-material-design-react/)\\n- [](https://blog.openreplay.com/material-ui-vs-tailwind-css/#:~:text=Theming%3A%20Material%20UI%20provides%20powerful,editing%20the%20classes%20upon%20usage.)"},{"id":"new-hire-perspective","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/new-hire-perspective","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-16-new-hire-perspective/index.md","title":"A New Hire\'s Perspective- First Months at Summer Health","description":"New hire\'s perspective into Summer Health\'s mission and Teamwork at Summer Health","date":"2023-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 16, 2023","tags":[{"label":"team","permalink":"/blog/tags/team"},{"label":"engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/engineering"},{"label":"healthcare-tech","permalink":"/blog/tags/healthcare-tech"}],"readingTime":4.78,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Rachel Kim","imageURL":"https://github.com/RachMKim.png","key":"RachMKim"},{"name":"ChatGPT","url":"https://chat.openai.com/","imageURL":"https://chat.openai.com/apple-touch-icon.png","key":"chatgpt"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"new-hire-perspective","title":"A New Hire\'s Perspective- First Months at Summer Health","description":"New hire\'s perspective into Summer Health\'s mission and Teamwork at Summer Health","authors":["RachMKim","chatgpt"],"tags":["team","engineering","healthcare-tech"],"image":"/img/rachel-new-hire-perspective-social-card.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Why We Use MUI","permalink":"/blog/2023/08/23/why-we-use-mui"},"nextItem":{"title":"A Better Healthcare Experience","permalink":"/blog/2023/08/10/care-os"}},"content":"![Summer Health Engineering Banner](./rachel-banner.png)\\n\\n# Embarking on a Transformative Journey\\n\\nFour months ago, I embarked on a new adventure, transitioning from the world of classical violin to the dynamic realm of healthcare technology at Summer Health.

The age-old EHR systems, teeming with irrelevant\\nfields and buttons, can bring back painful memories. What exacerbates this is\\nthat these traditional EHRs are focused on appointments and billing\\ninstead of being focused on providing care.\\n\\nSummer Health focuses on direct-to-consumer care that\'s available around the\\nclock. We\'re not just streamlining healthcare for parents; we\'re tailoring it\\nfor the pediatricians so they can provide the highest quality care without\\nbeing burdened by outdated tech.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWe envision a healthcare experience that enables quality care without\\nsacrificing simplicity and security. From this vision, CareOS was born. However,\\ncreating a new healthcare experience from the ground up takes a lot of work,\\nand we\'re not interested in reinventing the wheel. This post covers some core\\nconcepts that were and continue to be important to us as we build a world-class\\nhealthcare experience.\\n\\n## The Right Foundation\\n\\nThe fastest way to a skeptical look is by telling someone you\'re going\\nto build an EHR from scratch. It\'s a daunting task, and skepticism is warranted.\\nThat\'s why while we knew we needed a better experience for our pediatricians,\\nbuilding everything from scratch wasn\'t the right approach. We explored different\\nheadless and headed options, weighing the limitations and expenses. We needed the\\nflexibility to build a custom experience without committing to a future operational\\nnightmare.\\n\\nThat\'s where Medplum came into play. Developer-friendly and forward-thinking,\\nMedplum\'s healthcare platform resonated with our vision and allowed us\\nto build a high quality experience without starting from 0.\\n\\n## Identity Management\\n\\nBeing a seed-stage company, Summer Health must keep the identities involved in\\nhealthcare flexible. As we evolve and uncover new product dimensions, there\'s a\\npressing need for adaptability. Yet, security remains paramount and clinical\\ndata access needs to be restricted only to pertinent entities.\\n\\nRecognizing this, we aimed for a healthcare platform that offers flexible\\n[identity management](https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth). So\\nwhether it\u2019s a Summer Health employee, a partnering practitioner or a parent,\\nwe can operate in one environment under one auth umbrella.\\n\\n## Access Control\\n\\nFiguring out identity management was just the tip of the iceberg. Pediatrics has\\na unique challenge in terms of data access. Unlike other specialties, a\\npediatric patient\'s clinical data must be accessible by different identities,\\nlike parents or guardians. So, how do we ensure that the right individuals have\\nthe correct access while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data?\\nThis complexity needs a\\n[nuanced approach to access control](https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth/access-control),\\nand we needed a platform with an answer.\\n\\n## Everything is on FHIR \ud83d\udd25\\n\\nOur vision was broader than the present. We knew our data storage methods\\ntoday would impact future interoperability with partners and other healthcare\\nsystems. This led us to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), a\\nstandard framework for clinical data storage. Adopting FHIR meant ensuring our\\ndata remains legible outside the confines of Summer Health, promising a brighter\\nfuture for our patients and their relationships with other clinical entities.\\n\\n## Mobile First\\n\\nOur pediatricians, much like our parents, rely on mobile devices. The availability\\nof Summer Health across the US, every single day of the week, 24 hours a day, is\\nrooted in mobile accessibility. It\'s pivotal for our pediatricians to\\nprovide uninterrupted, high-quality care, irrespective of their location.\\nWe wanted to craft a user-friendly, mobile-first experience for them, ensuring\\nthey have all the necessary information at their fingertips to provide\\nthe highest quality care.\\n\\n![CareOS screenshots](./care-os-screenshots.png)\\n\\n## More to Come\\n\\nSummer Health\u2019s path to revolutionize pediatric care starts with ensuring our\\npediatricians have the best tools to provide the best care. We\u2019ll continue to\\nshare more about how we\u2019re building CareOS as we continue this journey.

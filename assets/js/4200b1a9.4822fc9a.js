The age-old EHR systems, teeming with irrelevant\\nfields and buttons, bring back painful memories. These traditional EHRs are\\ntoo focused on appointment-based care, billing, and assigning\\nproviders.\\n\\nSummer Health focuses on direct-to-consumer care that\'s available around the\\nclock. We\'re not just streamlining healthcare for parents; we\'re tailoring it\\nfor the pediatricians so they can provide the highest quality care without\\nbeing burdened by outdated tech.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWe have a vision for healthcare tools that truly enable quality care without\\nsacrificing simplicity and security. From this vision, CareOS was born. However,\\ncreating a new healthcare platform from the ground up takes work.\\nWe needed a reliable foundation so that we can focus on the problems that matter\\nmost.\\n\\nThat\'s where Medplum came into play.\\nDeveloper-friendly and forward-thinking, Medplum\'s healthcare platform\\nresonated with our vision. This\\npost includes some core concepts that were important to us and how Medplum\u2019s\\nteam helped us address them.\\n\\n## Identity Management\\n\\nBeing a seed-stage company, Summer Health must keep the identities involved in\\nhealthcare flexible. As we evolve and uncover new product dimensions, there\'s a\\npressing need for adaptability. Yet, security remains paramount and clinical\\ndata access needs to be restricted only to pertinent entities.\\n\\nRecognizing this, we aimed for a healthcare platform that offers\\n[identity management flexibility](https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth). So\\nwhether it\u2019s a Summer Health employee, a partnering practitioner or a parent,\\nwe can operate in one environment under one auth umbrella.\\n\\n## Access Control\\n\\nFiguring out identity management was just the tip of the iceberg. Pediatrics has\\na unique challenge in terms of data access. Unlike other specialties, a\\npediatric patient\'s clinical data must be accessible by different identities,\\nlike parents or guardians. So, how do we ensure that the right individuals have\\nthe correct\\naccess, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data? This complexity\\nneeds a\\n[nuanced approach to access control](https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth/access-control),\\nand we needed a platform with an answer.\\n\\n## Everything is on FHIR \ud83d\udd25\\n\\nOur vision was broader than the present. We knew our data storage methods\\ntoday would impact future interoperability with partners and other healthcare\\nsystems. This led us to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), a\\nstandard framework for clinical data storage. Adopting FHIR meant ensuring our\\ndata remains legible outside the confines of Summer Health, promising a brighter\\nfuture for our patients and their relationships with various clinical entities.\\n\\n## Mobile First\\n\\nIn the age of digitization, mobile devices are at the heart of healthcare. Our\\npediatricians, much like parents, rely on mobile devices. The availability of\\nSummer Health across the US, every single day of the week, is rooted in mobile\\naccessibility. It\'s pivotal for our pediatricians to provide uninterrupted,\\nhigh-quality care, irrespective of their location. We wanted to craft a\\nuser-friendly, mobile-first experience for them, ensuring they have all the\\nnecessary information at their fingertips and can update parents without any hassles.\\n\\nThanks to the strong foundation in place, we could put most of our focus into\\nthat mobile-friendly experience, allowing us to focus on the problems that\\nmattered to our patients.\\n\\n![CareOS screenshots](./care-os-screenshots.png)\\n\\n## More to Come\\n\\nSummer Health\u2019s path to revolutionize pediatric care starts with ensuring our\\npediatricians have the best tools to provide the best care. We\u2019ll continue to\\nshare more about how we\u2019re building CareOS as we continue this journey. In the\\nmeantime, you can learn more details about our integration with Medplum in the\\ncase study:\\n[24/7 Pediatrician Access - Summer Health Case Study](https://www.medplum.com/blog/summer-case-study)"},{"id":"summer-health-engineering","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/summer-health-engineering","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-05-summer-health-engineering/index.md","title":"Summer Health Engineering","description":"About our engineering team","date":"2023-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"team","permalink":"/blog/tags/team"},{"label":"engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/engineering"},{"label":"ai-assisted","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai-assisted"}],"readingTime":2.32,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Rodriguez","imageURL":"https://github.com/jrodbeta.png","key":"jrodbeta"},{"name":"ChatGPT","url":"https://chat.openai.com/","imageURL":"https://chat.openai.com/apple-touch-icon.png","key":"chatgpt"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"summer-health-engineering","title":"Summer Health Engineering","description":"About our engineering team","authors":["jrodbeta","chatgpt"],"tags":["team","engineering","ai-assisted"],"image":"/img/summer-health-social-card.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"A Better Provider Experience","permalink":"/blog/2023/08/10/care-os"}},"content":"![Summer Health Engineering Banner](./summer-health-banner.png)\\n\\nAt Summer Health, we\'re reinventing the world of pediatric care with a unique\\nvision: to place a doctor in every parent\'s pocket. With an innovative platform\\nthat connects parents to a pediatrician within 15 minutes, our commitment to\\nhealthcare is as uncomplicated as sending a text message. This formidable\\nchallenge of integrating healthcare, technology, and convenience presents our\\nteam with a wealth of engineering problems. However, our growth-minded,\\nproblem-solving approach helps us continually rise to these challenges.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Our Growth Mindset\\n\\nCentral to our engineering team\'s philosophy is a strong growth mindset.\\nEverything we do is focused on continual improvement - whether it\'s our\\nprocesses, our technology stack, conventions, or even our team dynamics.\\nEvery team member is encouraged to contribute to this process of evolution.\\nFrom refining code, streamlining workflows or reducing meeting redundancies,\\nevery bit helps to ensure we operate at peak efficiency.\\n\\n## Problem Solvers, Not Just Delivery Engineers\\n\\nAnother key aspect that sets us apart is that we are not just \\"delivery engineers\\"\\n\u2013 we\'re a problem-solving team. Our engineers play an integral role in the\\ncreative process, defining, understanding, and formulating solutions for the\\nchallenges we face. This mindset takes us beyond simply delivering a product;\\nit turns us into innovators, continually reshaping our approach to ensure we\\nprovide the best pediatric care.\\n\\n## Diversity and Inclusion\\n\\nWe believe in the power of diversity and inclusivity.

The richness of ideas, viewpoints, and experiences that stem\\nfrom this diversity fosters innovation, drives creativity, and enables us to\\nsolve complex problems in novel ways.\\n\\n## High Collaboration, High Iteration\\n\\nOur day-to-day is highly collaborative and iterative. We implement practices\\nlike continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment,\\nencouraging engineers to merge multiple items to production daily. By breaking\\ndown features into smaller increments, we can rally around similar goals,\\naccelerating our critical path quickly.\\n\\nPair programming is a cornerstone of our team culture, and we also place\\nimmense value on internal documentation to help each other understand ideas\\nand align on conventions. We\'re always seeking ways to improve our productivity,\\nand often, this means turning convention into automation so we can focus on\\nthe problems that matter most.\\n\\n## Into the Future\\n\\nAt Summer Health, we\'re leveraging technology and teamwork to transform pediatric\\ncare, bringing it to parents\' fingertips. Our growth-minded, problem-solving\\nengineering team is at the heart of this revolution, driving us forward, one\\nline of code at a time.

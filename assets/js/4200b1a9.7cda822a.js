The age-old EHR systems, teeming with irrelevant\\nfields and buttons, can bring back painful memories. What exacerbates this is\\nthat these traditional EHRs are focused on appointments and billing\\ninstead of being focused on providing care.\\n\\nSummer Health focuses on direct-to-consumer care that\'s available around the\\nclock. We\'re not just streamlining healthcare for parents; we\'re tailoring it\\nfor the pediatricians so they can provide the highest quality care without\\nbeing burdened by outdated tech.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWe envision a healthcare experience that enables quality care without\\nsacrificing simplicity and security. From this vision, CareOS was born. However,\\ncreating a new healthcare experience from the ground up takes a lot of work,\\nand we\'re not interested in reinventing the wheel. This post covers some core\\nconcepts that were and continue to be important to us as we build a world-class\\nhealthcare experience.\\n\\n## The Right Foundation\\n\\nThe fastest way to a skeptical look is by telling someone you\'re going\\nto build an EHR from scratch. It\'s a daunting task, and skepticism is warranted.\\nThat\'s why while we knew we needed a better experience for our pediatricians,\\nbuilding everything from scratch wasn\'t the right approach. We explored different\\nheadless and headed options, weighing the limitations and expenses. We needed the\\nflexibility to build a custom experience without committing to a future operational\\nnightmare.\\n\\nThat\'s where Medplum came into play. Developer-friendly and forward-thinking,\\nMedplum\'s healthcare platform resonated with our vision and allowed us\\nto build a high quality experience without starting from 0.\\n\\n## Identity Management\\n\\nBeing a seed-stage company, Summer Health must keep the identities involved in\\nhealthcare flexible. As we evolve and uncover new product dimensions, there\'s a\\npressing need for adaptability. Yet, security remains paramount and clinical\\ndata access needs to be restricted only to pertinent entities.\\n\\nRecognizing this, we aimed for a healthcare platform that offers flexible\\n[identity management](https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth). So\\nwhether it\u2019s a Summer Health employee, a partnering practitioner or a parent,\\nwe can operate in one environment under one auth umbrella.\\n\\n## Access Control\\n\\nFiguring out identity management was just the tip of the iceberg. Pediatrics has\\na unique challenge in terms of data access. Unlike other specialties, a\\npediatric patient\'s clinical data must be accessible by different identities,\\nlike parents or guardians. So, how do we ensure that the right individuals have\\nthe correct access while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data?\\nThis complexity needs a\\n[nuanced approach to access control](https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth/access-control),\\nand we needed a platform with an answer.\\n\\n## Everything is on FHIR \ud83d\udd25\\n\\nOur vision was broader than the present. We knew our data storage methods\\ntoday would impact future interoperability with partners and other healthcare\\nsystems. This led us to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), a\\nstandard framework for clinical data storage. Adopting FHIR meant ensuring our\\ndata remains legible outside the confines of Summer Health, promising a brighter\\nfuture for our patients and their relationships with other clinical entities.\\n\\n## Mobile First\\n\\nOur pediatricians, much like our parents, rely on mobile devices. The availability\\nof Summer Health across the US, every single day of the week, 24 hours a day, is\\nrooted in mobile accessibility. It\'s pivotal for our pediatricians to\\nprovide uninterrupted, high-quality care, irrespective of their location.\\nWe wanted to craft a user-friendly, mobile-first experience for them, ensuring\\nthey have all the necessary information at their fingertips to provide\\nthe highest quality care.\\n\\n![CareOS screenshots](./care-os-screenshots.png)\\n\\n## More to Come\\n\\nSummer Health\u2019s path to revolutionize pediatric care starts with ensuring our\\npediatricians have the best tools to provide the best care. We\u2019ll continue to\\nshare more about how we\u2019re building CareOS as we continue this journey.

With an innovative platform\\nthat connects parents to a pediatrician within 15 minutes, our commitment to\\nhealthcare is as uncomplicated as sending a text message. This formidable\\nchallenge of integrating healthcare, technology, and convenience presents our\\nteam with a wealth of engineering problems. However, our growth-minded,\\nproblem-solving approach helps us continually rise to these challenges.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Our Growth Mindset\\n\\nCentral to our engineering team\'s philosophy is a strong growth mindset.\\nEverything we do is focused on continual improvement - whether it\'s our\\nprocesses, our technology stack, conventions, or even our team dynamics.\\nEvery team member is encouraged to contribute to this process of evolution.\\nFrom refining code, streamlining workflows or reducing meeting redundancies,\\nevery bit helps to ensure we operate at peak efficiency.\\n\\n## Problem Solvers, Not Just Delivery Engineers\\n\\nAnother key aspect that sets us apart is that we are not just \\"delivery engineers\\"\\n\u2013 we\'re a problem-solving team. Our engineers play an integral role in the\\ncreative process, defining, understanding, and formulating solutions for the\\nchallenges we face. This mindset takes us beyond simply delivering a product;\\nit turns us into innovators, continually reshaping our approach to ensure we\\nprovide the best pediatric care.\\n\\n## Diversity and Inclusion\\n\\nWe believe in the power of diversity and inclusivity.

The richness of ideas, viewpoints, and experiences that stem\\nfrom this diversity fosters innovation, drives creativity, and enables us to\\nsolve complex problems in novel ways.\\n\\n## High Collaboration, High Iteration\\n\\nOur day-to-day is highly collaborative and iterative. We implement practices\\nlike continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment,\\nencouraging engineers to merge multiple items to production daily. By breaking\\ndown features into smaller increments, we can rally around similar goals,\\naccelerating our critical path quickly.\\n\\nPair programming is a cornerstone of our team culture, and we also place\\nimmense value on internal documentation to help each other understand ideas\\nand align on conventions. We\'re always seeking ways to improve our productivity,\\nand often, this means turning convention into automation so we can focus on\\nthe problems that matter most.\\n\\n## Into the Future\\n\\nAt Summer Health, we\'re leveraging technology and teamwork to transform pediatric\\ncare, bringing it to parents\' fingertips. Our growth-minded, problem-solving\\nengineering team is at the heart of this revolution, driving us forward, one\\nline of code at a time.

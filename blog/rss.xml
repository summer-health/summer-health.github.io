            <description><![CDATA[How we're building a world-class experience for pediatricians]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every pediatrician knows the strain of a cluttered and convoluted Electronic
Health Record (EHR) system. The age-old EHR systems, teeming with irrelevant
fields and buttons, bring back painful memories. These traditional EHRs are
too focused on appointment-based care, billing, and assigning
providers.</p><p>Summer Health focuses on direct-to-consumer care that's available around the
clock. We're not just streamlining healthcare for parents; we're tailoring it
for the pediatricians so they can provide the highest quality care without
being burdened by outdated tech.</p><p>We have a vision for healthcare tools that truly enable quality care without
sacrificing simplicity and security. From this vision, CareOS was born. However,
creating a new healthcare platform from the ground up takes work.
We needed a reliable foundation so that we can focus on the problems that matter
most.</p><p>That's where Medplum came into play.
Developer-friendly and forward-thinking, Medplum's healthcare platform
resonated with our vision. This
post includes some core concepts that were important to us and how Medplumâ€™s
team helped us address them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="identity-management">Identity Management<a href="#identity-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Identity Management" title="Direct link to Identity Management">â€‹</a></h2><p>Being a seed-stage company, Summer Health must keep the identities involved in
healthcare flexible. As we evolve and uncover new product dimensions, there's a
pressing need for adaptability. Yet, security remains paramount and clinical
data access needs to be restricted only to pertinent entities.</p><p>Recognizing this, we aimed for a healthcare platform that offers
<a href="https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">identity management flexibility</a>. So
whether itâ€™s a Summer Health employee, a partnering practitioner or a parent,
we can operate in one environment under one auth umbrella.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="access-control">Access Control<a href="#access-control" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Access Control" title="Direct link to Access Control">â€‹</a></h2><p>Figuring out identity management was just the tip of the iceberg. Pediatrics has
a unique challenge in terms of data access. Unlike other specialties, a
pediatric patient's clinical data must be accessible by different identities,
like parents or guardians. So, how do we ensure that the right individuals have
the correct
access, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data? This complexity
needs a
<a href="https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth/access-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nuanced approach to access control</a>,
and we needed a platform with an answer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="everything-is-on-fhir-">Everything is on FHIR ðŸ”¥<a href="#everything-is-on-fhir-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Everything is on FHIR ðŸ”¥" title="Direct link to Everything is on FHIR ðŸ”¥">â€‹</a></h2><p>Our vision was broader than the present. We knew our data storage methods
today would impact future interoperability with partners and other healthcare
systems. This led us to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), a
standard framework for clinical data storage. Adopting FHIR meant ensuring our
data remains legible outside the confines of Summer Health, promising a brighter
future for our patients and their relationships with various clinical entities.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mobile-first">Mobile First<a href="#mobile-first" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mobile First" title="Direct link to Mobile First">â€‹</a></h2><p>In the age of digitization, mobile devices are at the heart of healthcare. Our
pediatricians, much like parents, rely on mobile devices. The availability of
Summer Health across the US, every single day of the week, is rooted in mobile
accessibility. It's pivotal for our pediatricians to provide uninterrupted,
high-quality care, irrespective of their location. We wanted to craft a
user-friendly, mobile-first experience for them, ensuring they have all the
necessary information at their fingertips and can update parents without any hassles.</p><p>Thanks to the strong foundation in place, we could put most of our focus into
that mobile-friendly experience, allowing us to focus on the problems that
mattered to our patients.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="CareOS screenshots" src="/assets/images/care-os-screenshots-f6d236fa407b0eea40e9f49bd4443d7e.png" width="3240" height="2400" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-to-come">More to Come<a href="#more-to-come" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More to Come" title="Direct link to More to Come">â€‹</a></h2><p>Summer Healthâ€™s path to revolutionize pediatric care starts with ensuring our
pediatricians have the best tools to provide the best care. Weâ€™ll continue to
share more about how weâ€™re building CareOS as we continue this journey. In the
meantime, you can learn more details about our integration with Medplum in the

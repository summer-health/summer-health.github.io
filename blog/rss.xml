            <description><![CDATA[How we're building a world-class experience for pediatricians]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every pediatrician knows the strain of a cluttered and convoluted Electronic
Health Record (EHR) system. The age-old EHR systems, teeming with irrelevant
fields and buttons, can bring back painful memories. What exacerbates this is
that these traditional EHRs are focused on appointments and billing
instead of being focused on providing care.</p><p>Summer Health focuses on direct-to-consumer care that's available around the
clock. We're not just streamlining healthcare for parents; we're tailoring it
for the pediatricians so they can provide the highest quality care without
being burdened by outdated tech.</p><p>We envision a healthcare experience that enables quality care without
sacrificing simplicity and security. From this vision, CareOS was born. However,
creating a new healthcare experience from the ground up takes a lot of work,
and we're not interested in reinventing the wheel. This post covers some core
concepts that were and continue to be important to us as we build a world-class
healthcare experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-right-foundation">The Right Foundation<a href="#the-right-foundation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Right Foundation" title="Direct link to The Right Foundation">â€‹</a></h2><p>The fastest way to a skeptical look is by telling someone you're going
to build an EHR from scratch. It's a daunting task, and skepticism is warranted.
That's why while we knew we needed a better experience for our pediatricians,
building everything from scratch wasn't the right approach. We explored different
headless and headed options, weighing the limitations and expenses. We needed the
flexibility to build a custom experience without committing to a future operational
nightmare.</p><p>That's where Medplum came into play. Developer-friendly and forward-thinking,
Medplum's healthcare platform resonated with our vision and allowed us
to build a high quality experience without starting from 0.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="identity-management">Identity Management<a href="#identity-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Identity Management" title="Direct link to Identity Management">â€‹</a></h2><p>Being a seed-stage company, Summer Health must keep the identities involved in
healthcare flexible. As we evolve and uncover new product dimensions, there's a
pressing need for adaptability. Yet, security remains paramount and clinical
data access needs to be restricted only to pertinent entities.</p><p>Recognizing this, we aimed for a healthcare platform that offers flexible
<a href="https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">identity management</a>. So
whether itâ€™s a Summer Health employee, a partnering practitioner or a parent,
we can operate in one environment under one auth umbrella.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="access-control">Access Control<a href="#access-control" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Access Control" title="Direct link to Access Control">â€‹</a></h2><p>Figuring out identity management was just the tip of the iceberg. Pediatrics has
a unique challenge in terms of data access. Unlike other specialties, a
pediatric patient's clinical data must be accessible by different identities,
like parents or guardians. So, how do we ensure that the right individuals have
the correct access while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data?
This complexity needs a
<a href="https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth/access-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nuanced approach to access control</a>,
and we needed a platform with an answer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="everything-is-on-fhir-">Everything is on FHIR ðŸ”¥<a href="#everything-is-on-fhir-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Everything is on FHIR ðŸ”¥" title="Direct link to Everything is on FHIR ðŸ”¥">â€‹</a></h2><p>Our vision was broader than the present. We knew our data storage methods
today would impact future interoperability with partners and other healthcare
systems. This led us to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), a
standard framework for clinical data storage. Adopting FHIR meant ensuring our
data remains legible outside the confines of Summer Health, promising a brighter
future for our patients and their relationships with other clinical entities.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mobile-first">Mobile First<a href="#mobile-first" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mobile First" title="Direct link to Mobile First">â€‹</a></h2><p>Our pediatricians, much like our parents, rely on mobile devices. The availability
of Summer Health across the US, every single day of the week, 24 hours a day, is
rooted in mobile accessibility. It's pivotal for our pediatricians to
provide uninterrupted, high-quality care, irrespective of their location.
We wanted to craft a user-friendly, mobile-first experience for them, ensuring
they have all the necessary information at their fingertips to provide
the highest quality care.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="CareOS screenshots" src="/assets/images/care-os-screenshots-f6d236fa407b0eea40e9f49bd4443d7e.png" width="3240" height="2400" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-to-come">More to Come<a href="#more-to-come" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More to Come" title="Direct link to More to Come">â€‹</a></h2><p>Summer Healthâ€™s path to revolutionize pediatric care starts with ensuring our
pediatricians have the best tools to provide the best care. Weâ€™ll continue to
share more about how weâ€™re building CareOS as we continue this journey. In the
meantime, you can learn more details about our integration with Medplum in the
